# AWS_S3_Clothing_Recommendations

Infuenced by the python script I wrote, with clothing recommendations based on weather specification input by the user, I decided it to host it on an S3 bucket as a static website.


## Create and configure bucket

Then I create my bucket, enable public access, static website hosting and upload an appropriate policy.

After that, I upload my files.

## Test the website

I locate the url of the website I created.

Finally, I test the website, which works properly. You can visit it here http://what-to-wear-tomorrow-bucket.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/
